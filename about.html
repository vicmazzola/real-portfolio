            <p class="presentation__content__text">I'm Victor Mazzola, 27 years old. I am currently pursuing a degree in
                Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP, with an expected graduation in 2025. Throughout my
                professional journey, I have gained experience in various areas that have contributed to my development.

                I have a diverse professional background, starting as an Apprentice in the Acessa Escola project by
                the SÃ£o Paulo state government, and then as an apprentice at Ambev, where I acquired communication and
                teamwork skills. As a sales associate at Vila Romana, I improved my customer service and sales skills,
                dealing with a variety of customer profiles. At Evolution, an iGaming company in Malta, I developed
                multitasking and adaptability skills by interacting with players from various nationalities, which also
                improved my English proficiency to an advanced level. I also speak intermediate-level Italian.

                I have taken courses in HTML, CSS, Python, and UX Design at Alura, which have supported my academic
                training and enabled me to contribute to front-end development projects. My experience in diverse
                environments and my adaptability allow me to tackle challenges with creativity and efficiency.</p>
