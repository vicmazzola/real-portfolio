<h1>My Portfolio</h1>

A few months ago, I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During a course at Alura, I created a portfolio. Over time, I decided to update it, applying the knowledge I acquired over these months. 
I'm happy to see my progress from six months ago until now! I made the portfolio in both English and Portuguese.
